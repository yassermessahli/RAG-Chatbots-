    "You're working for a well-known car manufacturer who is looking at implementing LLMs into vehicles to provide guidance to drivers. You've been asked to experiment with integrating car manuals with an LLM to create a context-aware chatbot. They hope that this context-aware LLM can be hooked up to a text-to-speech software to read the model's response aloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a proof of concept, you'll integrate several pages from a car manual that contains car warning messages and their meanings and recommended actions. This particular manual, stored as an HTML file, `mg-zs-warning-messages.html`, is from an MG ZS, a compact SUV. Armed with your newfound knowledge of LLMs and LangChain, you'll implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create the context-aware chatbot.\n",
